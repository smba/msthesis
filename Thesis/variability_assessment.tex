\section{Variability Model Synthesis}  \label{sec:feature_model_synthesis}
A variability model as an abstraction of functionality of a software system is
required, or at least of great interest, in many contexts. 

\emph{First}, not
every configurable system provides an explicit
representation of its variability model. 
The reasons for inexplicit or absent configuration specification are manifold.
They can range from poor or inconsistent documentation
\citep{rabkin_static_2011} to overly complex configurability
\citep{xu_hey_2015}, or configuration constraints originated in different layers of a software
system, such as build constraints  or compiler constraints
\citep{nadi_where_2015}.

\emph{Second}, variability models have emerged to be a useful means in domain
analysis prior to developing a software system. As feature diagrams group and
organize features (representing functionality), synthesizing a variability model
has shown to be applicable to extract features and constraints from functional requirements.
In addition, by comparison of product specifications for an
existing market domain, variability models can provide a detailed feature
summary \citep{alves_exploratory_2008,bakar_feature_2015}.

For this thesis, we focus on the first aspect of synthesizing variability
models as our work addresses the assessment of already existing configurable
software systems. Nonetheless, many techniques employed in the aforementioned
second aspect consider similar problems, yet rely on natural language artifacts
rather than code artifacts \citep{alves_exploratory_2008,bakar_feature_2015}.
The following section recalls work on extracting configuration options and
constraints from source code as well as the organization of constraints into
feature hierarchy and groups. The further assessment of configurable systems
requires a well-defined and sound variability model.

\subsection{Feature Extraction} 
The first objective in recovering a variability model from a configurable
system is to determine the available configuration options to select
from. In addition, for further configuration, the type of each configuration
option (e.g., boolean, numeric, or string) and the respective domain of valid
values needs to be specified.

\cite{rabkin_static_2011} proposed a static, yet heuristic approach to extract
configuration options along with respective types and domains. Their approach
exploits the usage of configuration APIs and works
in two stages. It commences with extracting all code sections where
configuration options are parsed. Next, configuration names can be
recovered as they are either already specified at compile-time or can be
reconstructed using string analysis yielding respective regular expressions.
Moreover, the authors employ a number of heuristics to infer the type of parsed
configurations as well as respective domains. First, the return type of the
parsing method is likely to indicate the type of the configuration option read.
Second, if a string is read initially, the library method it is passed to can
reveal valuable information about the actual type. For instance, a method
\emph{parseInteger} is likely to parse an integer value. Third, whenever a
parsed configuration option is compared against a constant, expression, or value
of an enum class, these might indicate valid values or at least corner cases of
the configuration option domain. The extraction method by
\cite{rabkin_static_2011} is precise, but limited, for instance, when an
option leaves the scope of the source code.
Nonetheless, for the systems studied, the authors were able to recover
configuration options that were not documented, only used for debugging or even not used at
all.

\subsection{Constraint Extraction}
The second step in recovering a variability model is the
extraction of configuration constraints. An approach proposed by \cite{zhou_extracting_2015}
focuses on the extraction of file presence conditions from build files using symbolic execution. A more comprehensive investigation of configuration
constraints and their origin is provided by \cite{nadi_mining_2014,nadi_where_2015}. They
use variability-aware parsing to infer constraints by
evaluating make files and  analyzing preprocessor directives. Inferred
constraints result from violations of two assumed rules, where (a) every valid
configuration must not contain build-time errors and (b) every valid
configuration should result in a lexically different program. While the
first rule aims at inferring constraints that prevent build-time errors, the
second one is intended to detect features without any effect, at least as part
of some configurations. Their analysis one the one hand emerged to be accurate
in recovering constraints with 93\,\% for constraints inferred by the first rule
and 77\,\% for second one respectively. On the other hand, their approach
recovered only 28\,\% of all constraints present in the software system.
Further qualitative investigation, including developer interviews, lead to
the conclusion that most of existing constraints stem from domain knowledge
\citep{nadi_where_2015}.

\subsection{Feature Hierarchy Recovery} \label{sec:feature_hierarchy}
Besides recovering configuration options and respective constraints, to reverse
engineer a feature model, one further step is required. The recovered knowledge
needs to be organized in a tree-like hierarchy with feature groups specified and
CTCs explicitly stated to derive a valid feature diagram 
\citep{kang_feature-oriented_1990}.
While several approaches for recovering the feature model hierarchy have been
proposed, we are primarily interested in finding a hierarchy for knowledge
obtained from source code. Other scenarios, as already stated in the opener of
this section, are based on product descriptions or sets of valid configurations
\citep{aleti_software_2013,bakar_feature_2015}. In the remainder of this
subsection, we will focus on organizing features and constraints extracted from
source code. For further reading, \cite{andersen_efficient_2012} present algorithms for structuring feature diagrams for three different scenarios including the ones previously mentioned.

Given an extracted set of features along with corresponding descriptions and
recovered constraints among the features, \cite{she_reverse_2011} propose a
semi-automated and interactive approach to synthesize a feature hierarchy.
Their approach comprises three tasks. First, an overall feature hierarchy based
on feature implications is specified. Second, potential feature groups are
detected and manually selected. Finally, the feature diagram is extended with
remaining CTCs. A detailed description of the algorithm is presented below:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The algorithm commences with finding a single parent for each
  feature and, thus, specifying a tree-like feature hierarchy. Based on the
  given constraints, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing implication
  relationships among features, a so-called \emph{implication graph}, is
  constructed.
  Every vertex in the implication graph represents a feature  and edges are
  inserted for each pair of features $(u, v)$, where  $u \implies v$ holds with respect to the given
  constraints.
   
  In addition to the implication graph, the algorithm for each feature computes
  two rankings of features that are likely to be the respective parent feature.
  The two rankings both employ the feature descriptions. Feature descriptions
  are compared for similarity using a similarity metric. For two features $p$
  and $s$, the similarity is defined as the weighted sum of the inverse document
  frequencies $idf(w)$ for the words that both descriptions of features $p$
  and $s$ share.
  The $idf$-ranking for a word $w$ is the logarithm of the number of features
  divided by the number of features whose description contains $w$. Each $idf$
  value is weighted with the frequency of $w$ in the description of
  feature $p$.
  
  The first ranking, called Ranked-Implied-Features (RIF), for each feature $f$
  ranks all features by their similarity to $f$ in an descending order, but
  prioritizes those features that are implied according to the previously
  computed implication graph. The second ranking, called Ranked-All-Features
  (RAF) is similar to RIF, yet less strict since implied features are not
  prioritized. Given these rankings, a user for each feature selects a suitable
  parent feature from the RIF or RAF ranking. The idea behind providing two
  separate rankings, according to \cite{she_reverse_2011} is that the given
  extracted constraints can be incomplete and, thus, not all relevant
  implications are contained in the implication graph.

  \item After the feature hierarchy is specified, another auxiliary graph, a
  mutex graph, similar to the implication graph, is constructed. The \emph{mutex
  graph} is an undirected graph with features as vertices and edges between two
  features $u$ and $v$, if $u \implies \neg{v}$ and $v \implies \neg{u}$ hold
  with respect to the given constraints. 
  That is, all adjacent features are mutually exclusive. Based on
  this mutex graph, all maximal cliques (subsets of vertices that all are
  connected with each other) among the vertices with the same parent are
  computed. All features within such a clique are mutually exclusive and share
  the same parent and represent mutex- or alternative-groups. \cite{she_reverse_2011} introduce an
  additional constraint to extract xor-groups that require one of the groups’
  features to be selected if the parent is selected. This distinction is in
  line with the initial description of feature diagrams by \cite{kang_feature-oriented_1990},
  but not all descriptions of feature diagrams follow this distinction between
  mutex- and xor-groups and just use the term alternative-group discussed in 
  Sec. \ref{sec:variability_modeling}. %2.1
  
  \item CTCs for the feature diagram are extracted from
  the given configuration constraints. Since CTCs are constraints that could
  not be represented by the feature hierarchy (implication) or
  alternative-groups (exclusion), the derivation of CTCs follows this idea. The
  set of cross-tree implications is derived by removing all edges that are part
  of the feature hierarchy from the initially constructed implication graph.
  The set of cross-tree exclusions is derived similarly from the mutex
  graph by removing all edges among vertices of all mutex-groups. To make the
  feature model sound, the given configuration constraints, reduced to those
  clauses that are not already entailed by the diagram, can be added as an
  additional CTC formula to the feature diagram \citep{she_reverse_2011}.
\end{enumerate}

The approach by \cite{she_reverse_2011} provides a practical algorithm to synthesize a
feature diagram, yet has some limitations we need to consider. First, the
approach is not able to detect or-groups as defined in Sec. \ref{sec:variability_modeling}.
Second, the approach does introduce a root feature. Finally, the approach does not
distinguish between mandatory and optional features. Implicitly, all features
that do not have a parent feature are optional and all features that have a
parent feature are by default mandatory. \cite{she_reverse_2011} evaluated the
algorithm with both complete and incomplete variability knowledge (feature
names, descriptions and constraints). While the algorithm has shown to be
practical, detecting features whose parent was the root-feature was difficult
since, due to the transitive property of implication, it is implied by each
feature of the feature model.

  \item How do the previously mentioned approaches relate to real-world
  situations?
  \item What artifacts can be used aside from code?
\end{itemize}

\section{Configuration Generation}
Apart from having knowledge about the variability of a configurable software
system, either in the form of a set of constraints among features, or a feature
diagram, we also need to derive all configurations, but at least meaningful
sample sets thereof, from the variability model. Variability models can be
expressed in various forms, such as propositional formulas or context-free
grammars (CFG) \citep{batory_feature_2005}, as well as constraint satisfaction
problems (CSP) \citep{benavides_automated_2005,benavides_using_2005}.
Accordingly, the all configurations represent solutions to propositional formulas or CSPs, and valid words for CFGs
respectively. That is, the generation of all configurations with respect to the
variability model is equivalent to finding a solution or word set for the
aforementioned representations of a variability model. In the following, we
look into how variability models can be encoded as a CSP and describe in detail
the configuration generation using CFGs.

\subsection{Constraint Satisfaction Problem}
A constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) in the context of variability modeling
describes a set of options ranging over finite domain as well as a set of
constraints which restrict which values variables can take simultaneously
\citep{benavides_automated_2005}. Fo a binary option $b$, the respective domain
$dom(b)$ simply is $\lbrace 0, 1\rbrace$.
For a numeric option, the respective domain $dom(n)$ is a finite set of legal
values with a minimum and a maximum value, say $\lbrace v_{min}, v_1,
v_2, \ldots, v_{max}\rbrace$.
A solution $s: O \rightarrow dom(o_1) \times dom(o_2) \times \ldots \times
dom(o_{|O|})$ to a CSP is an assignment of options $o_i \in O, i \in \mathbb{N}$
to values of their respective domain, such that all constraints are satisfied simultaneously \citep{benavides_automated_2005}.  

A solution to a CSP is found by systematically checking for different
selections of values whether all constraints are satisfied. There exists a
large number of ready-to-use SAT and CSP solvers, yet we are not covering CSP
solution here since it is beyond the scope of your thesis. For further reading, 
\citep{benavides_fama:_2007} present a tool with extensive analysis support for
various different presentations of variability models.

To encode a variability model as a CSP, \cite{benavides_automated_2005} describe
the following transformation rules:

\begin{itemize}
  \item For a parent feature $f$ and a child feature $f’$, a mandatory
  relationship is expressed as $f \Leftrightarrow f’$, and an optional relationship is
  expressed as $f’ \implies f$.
    \item  For a parent feature $f$ and child features $f_i$, where $i = 1, 2,
    \ldots n$, an or-group is expressed as $f \Leftrightarrow f_1 \lor f_2 \lor
    \ldots \lor f_n$, and an alternative-group is expressed as $$\bigwedge_{i
    = 0}^n f_i \Leftrightarrow (f \land \bigwedge_{j \in \lbrack 0, n \rbrack
    \setminus i} \neg f_j) $$.
\end{itemize}

To also consider numeric options, the domain of a numeric option $n$ can be
conceived as an alternative-group since only one value from the domain can be
selected at a time. Hence, each value of the domain $dom(n)$ can be conceived as
a binary option. If value $v \in dom(n)$ is selected, this states $n = v$,
otherwise $n \neq v$.


\subsection{Grammar Expansion}
Besides trying to find solution for satisfiability problems, the expression of
variability models as context-free grammars (CFGs) enables the derivation of
configurations directly from a CFG by expanding it. A
first description of transformation rules, yet only for feature diagrams with
binary options, was was proposed by \cite{batory_feature_2005}. A hierarchical feature diagram
can be recovered from a set of constraints using the algorithm of
\cite{she_reverse_2011} as explained in section \ref{sec:feature_hierarchy}.
In the following we describe
how a feature diagram with both binary and numeric features can be transformed
to a context-free grammar, and how configurations can be derived subsequently.

\begin{definition}[Context-free Grammar]\label{def:cfg}
A context-free grammar is a tuple $G = (N, T, S, P)$, consisting of a set of
non-terminal symbols $N$, a set of terminal symbols $T$, a start word $S \in (N
\cup T)^*$, and a set of productions $P \subseteq N \times (N \cup T)^*$. The
set $L_G$ describes the language of the grammar $G$ and comprises all valid
words $w \in L_G$ which can be derived from the start word $S \in L_G$ by
applying productions a finite number of times to it.
\end{definition}

Following the Definition.~\ref{def:cfg}, to derive all configurations for a
given feature diagram, the idea is to first translate it to a context-free
grammar. In order to do so, especially with respect to handling numeric
options, we introduce an extended definition for a CFG, a configuration
generation grammar.

\begin{definition}[Configuration Generation Grammar]\label{def:cgg}
A configuration generation grammar is a context-free grammar $G = (N, T, S,
P)$ whose elements are constructed from a feature diagram as follows.

\begin{itemize}
  \item All features represent non-terminal symbols $N$, which can be divided
  into two disjoint sets, binary non-terminal symbols $F_\mathcal{B}$ and
  numeric nont-terminal symbols $F_\mathcal{N}$. That is, $N = F_\mathcal{B}
  \cup F_\mathcal{N}$ and $F_\mathcal{B} \cap F_\mathcal{N} = \varnothing$.

  \item Similarly, the set of terminal symbols $T$ is consists of two different
  sets, the binary terminal symbols $T_\mathcal{B}$ and the numeric terminal
  symbols $T_\mathcal{N}$, so that $T = T_\mathcal{B} \cup T_\mathcal{N}$ and
  $T_\mathcal{B} \cap T_\mathcal{N} = \varnothing$ with
  
  \begin{equation}
  T_\mathcal{B} = \bigcup_{b\in F_\mathcal{B}} \lbrace b_0,  b_1\rbrace
  \end{equation}
  
  \begin{equation}
  T_\mathcal{N} = \bigcup_{n\in F_\mathcal{N}} ~ \bigcup_{v_i \in dom(n)}
  \lbrace n_{v_i}\rbrace.
  \end{equation}
  
  \item All productions $P$ are constructed from the hierarchy specified in the
  given feature diagram, the binary, and the numeric features. In our definition
  of a configuration grammar, each word $w$ is expressed as a subset of
  (non-)terminal symbols, i.e., $w \subseteq (N \cup T)$. A word is a terminal
  word, if and only if it does not contain any non-terminal symbol. Accordingly,
  the set of productions is $P \subseteq N \times (N \cup T)$, and a production
  $p = (u, v) \in P$ is applied to a word $w$ by removing non-terminal symbol
  $u$ from word $w$ and merging words $v$ and $w$. Hence, the new word $w'$ is
  defined as $w' = (w \setminus u) \cup v$.

  The productions $P = P_H \cup P_F$ are constructed from the following disjoint
  two sets of productions:
  
  \begin{equation}
  P_H = \lbrace (p, \lbrace c, c_1 \rbrace) | p, c \in N \land
  c \implies p\rbrace
  \end{equation}
  
  \begin{equation}
  P_F = \bigcup_{f \in (F_\mathcal{B} \cup F_\mathcal{N})} ~ \bigcup_{v \in
  dom(f)} \lbrace (f, v) \rbrace
  \end{equation}
	
  \item Finally, the start word $S \subseteq (N \cup T)$ consists the
  non-terminal representing the top-level feature in the given feature diagram.
  The set of respective configurations is described by all words which can be
  generated by a finite number of applications of productions to the start word
  $S$.
  
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Based on definition \ref{def:cgg}, we specify the following algorithm
\ref{alg:expand} to expand the configuration step by step and, thus, derive all valid words from the
grammar. The algorithm repeatedly derives new words by applying every production
possible to previously derived words. Once a word is terminal, i.e., does not
contain any non-terminal symbol, it is returned and not expanded any further.
The algorithm terminates if there is no word left to expand in the queue of
partial words.\\

\begin{algorithm}[H]\label{alg:expand}
 \KwData{Configuration generation grammar $G = \lbrace N, T, S, P \rbrace$, and
 cross-tree constraints $C$ of the given variability model}
 \KwResult{All configurations of the given variability model.}
 \vspace{5mm}
 words = Queue()\;
 words.enqueue($S$)\;
 \While{words is not empty}{
  current = words.dequeue()\;
  \If{current does violate any cross-tree constraint}{
   continue\;
   }
   \For{$n \in N$}{
   		\If{$n \in current$}{
   			\For{$u \in \lbrace u | (n, u) \in P \rbrace$}{
   				new = current\;
   				new = new $\setminus~ n$\;
   				new = new $\cup~ u$\;
   				\eIf{$N \cup new = \varnothing$}{
   					yield new\;
   				}{
   					words.enqueue(new)\;
   				}
   			}
   			break\;
   		}
   }
 }
 
 \caption{Expansion algorithm for a configuration generation grammar.}
\end{algorithm}\vspace{2mm}

In addition to deriving all configurations from a variability model, the
algorithm can also be used to derive partial configurations, such as
binary-only configurations. To do so, the numeric features need to be removed
from the set of non-terminal symbols. The only limitation of this algorithm is
that, conceptually, it requires all numeric options to be mandatory features.
This is due to the unspecified semantics of a numeric option being un- or
deselected.
