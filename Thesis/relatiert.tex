While to the best of our knowledge, there exists no previous work onexhaustively presenting a methodology to understand and comprehend performanceevolution of configurable system, existing related work and ours have eithertouched on similar topics, or pursue a similar methodology, yet with differentbasic premises. In the following we present and summarize related work toemphasize the limited scope of our work, and to give an outline of possiblefuture research directions.\paragraph{Comprehending Software Evolution.} Throughout our methodology, wehave frequently referred to visualizations of data obtained from repositorymining, for instance, for commit activity, and as a basis for revision samplingstrategies. In addition, we have taken into account similar data in theinterpretation of our performance evolution history data in section. Moregenerally speaking, software as a product is the result of a complexdevelopment process involving a repeatedly revised codebase, testing anddocumentation activity as well as records of developer communication, andorganizational artifacts and speifications. As software evolves, hence, it isinevitable to not consider those data to obtain more complete and integratedinsights. Aggregation and visualization of aforementioned data records can helpto sketch and understand possible coherences.\cite{german_visualizing_2006} have presented a comprehensive tool,\emph{softChange}, to visualize multiple aspects of a software systemâ€™sevolution history, including commit and file activity graphs, authorshipoverviews, and visualizations of file coupling. While their tool is notdesigned with regard to a specific research direction, the authors stress theimportance of means to aggregate and analyze software trails in order toexplore and understand software evolution. Joint visualizationsof software trails as well as performance evolution history data is a promisingaugmentation in the comprehension of multi-layered software evolution.\cite{wu_exploring_2004} have presented presented an integrated approach tovisualize multiple different measurements over time. Their proposed\emph{evolution spectrum graphs} are inspired by spectrum visualizations foraudio signals. A spectrum in their context can, for instance,  be a list of files, for whichdifferent measurements are illustrated over time. While this approach allows aglobal overview over an arbitrary timespan, it also can sketch fine-grainedchanges and trends over time. Although, according to the authors, thevisualizations need to be tailored to the target system with respect tocoloring and spectrum selection, evolution spectrum graphs can be a usefulmeans to aggregate and visualize various single-valued measurements for aspectrum of variants for configurable software systems.To conclude with a broader overview on visualization tools for further reading,\cite{storey_use_2005} have surveyed twelve tools (including the previouslymentioned two) that intend to visualize any kind of human activities insoftware development with a string focus on software evolution. The authorsevaluate the different tools with respect to different aspects, includingintent of the tools, the information sources utilized by the tools, the form ofpresentation offered by the tools, and the effectiveness in terms offeasibility and validity.\paragraph{Power Consumption as Performance Property.}\begin{itemize}  \item Awareness of power consumption as a quality property  \citep{sahin_how_2014,li_empirical_2014}  \item Methodology to power consumption assessment  \citep{hindle_green_2015,hindle_greenminer:_2014}\end{itemize}
