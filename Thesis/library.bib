Manual analysis requires a high level of domain-knowledge and understanding of softwarre metrics used in order to detect performance regressions by identifying deviations from anticipated behaviour or performance. They propose an automated approach based on performance history repositories and regression tests. For a given test case history, metrics are measured and ML learns a set of signatures best describing correlations between metrics. Consequently, any metric changing significantly or deviating from previously learned signatures may indicate defects related to performance regressions.

	abstract = {Developers of highly configurable performance-intensive soft-
ware systems often use a type of in-house performance-oriented
“regression testing” to ensure that their modifications have not
adversely affected their software’s performance across its large
configuration space. Unfortunately, time and resource constraints
often limit developers to in-house testing of a small number of con-
figurations and unreliable extrapolation from these results to the
entire configuration space, which allows many performance bot-
tlenecks and sources of QoS degradation to escape detection until
systems are fielded. To improve performance assessment of evolv-
ing systems across large configuration spaces, we have developed
a distributed continuous quality assurance (DCQA) process called
main effects screening that uses in-the-field resources to execute
formally designed experiments to help reduce the configuration
space, thereby allowing developers to perform more targeted in-
house QA. We have evaluated this process via several feasibility
studies on several large, widely-used performance-intensive soft-
ware systems. Our results indicate that main effects screening can
detect key sources of performance degradation in large-scale sys-
tems with significantly less effort than conventional techniques.},

(1) a mandatory feature can become optional, (2) for a mandatory/optional feature, a new alternative is introduced and (3) for an alternative feature, an additional, dependent feature is added. The basic change patterns in requirements/contexts are fourfold, including (a) a new driving context, (b) a weakend supportive context, (c) insufficient (non-functional) quality satisfaction and (d) unacceptable quality concession. Note that (c) and (d) both refer to the trade-off of non-functional reqiurements.They evaluate their model on a sample product line (CAGS-PL) and find the respective evolution patterns. They do not claim to have found a sound set of eovlution patterns, though more complex ones are expected to be composed from the forsaid patterns.

In addition, several approaches work in the presence of noise (inexpressive features).Chandrashekar and Sahin discuss three categories of algorithms, including filter methods, wrapper methods and embedded methods. Filter methods include Pearson/Spearmann correlation coefficient measures; wrapper methods comprises sequential methods (e.g., forward or backward feature selection) and heuristic approaches such as Genetic Algorithms; However, wrappe methods are explained briefly. Moreover, the paper touches classiiers (e.g., SVMs, NNs)and respective validation methods (cross-validation, 2- and k-fold validation).},

	abstract = {Feature code is often scattered across wide parts of the code base.
But, scattering is not necessarily bad if used with care—in fact,
systems with highly scattered features have evolved successfully
over years. Among others, feature scattering allows developers
to circumvent limitations in programming languages and system
design. Still, little is known about the characteristics governing
scattering, which factors influence it, and practical limits in the
evolution of large and long-lived systems.
We address this issue with a longitudinal case study of feature
scattering in the Linux kernel. We quantitatively and qualitatively
analyze almost eight years of its development history, focusing on
scattering of device-driver features. Among others, we show that,
while scattered features are regularly added, their proportion is
lower than non-scattered ones, indicating that the kernel architecture
allows most features to be integrated in a modular manner. The
median scattering degree of features is constant and low, but the
scattering-degree distribution is heavily skewed. Thus, using the
arithmetic mean is not a reliable threshold to monitor the evolution
of feature scattering. When investigating influencing factors, we find
that platform-driver features are 2.5 times more likely to be scattered
across architectural (subsystem) boundaries when compared to non-
platform ones. Their use illustrates a maintenance-performance
trade-off in creating architectures as for Linux kernel device drivers.},

The guidelines emphasize the importance of option relevance (how likely it might need to be selected), type (numeric vs discrete) and expressiveness (whether the effect can be anticipated). Simplification following these guideline showed a decrease in configuration options of up to 50\%. In addition, to find a desired configuration option basic keyword search might not be sufficient and is rather replaced by search-engines or NLP-based techniques.Xu. et al advocate for keeping configuration design simple.},

Constraints inferred according to these rules show high accuracy (93 and 77\%), yet only 27\% of all existing model constraints could be recovered in their four systems case study. Constraints are originated in the problem space as well as in the solution space.

	abstract = {Successful software evolves, more and more commonly, from
a single system to a set of system variants tailored to meet the similiar
and yet dierent functionality required by the distinct clients and
users. Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) is a software development
paradigm that has proven eective for coping with this scenario. At
the core of SPLE is variability modeling which employs Feature Models
(FMs) as the de facto standard to represent the combinations of features
that distinguish the systems variants. Reverse engineering FMs consist in
constructing a feature model from a set of products descriptions. This research
area is becoming increasingly active within the SPLE community,
where the problem has been addressed with dierent perspectives and
approaches ranging from analysis of conguration scripts, use of propositional
logic or natural language techniques, to ad hoc algorithms. In
this paper, we explore the feasibility of using Evolutionary Algorithms
(EAs) to synthesize FMs from the feature sets that describe the system
variants. We analyzed 59 representative case studies of dierent characteristics
and complexity. Our exploratory study found that FMs that
denote proper supersets of the desired feature sets can be obtained with a
small number of generations. However, reducing the dierences between
these two sets with an eective and scalable tness function remains an
open question. We believe that this work is a rst step towards leveraging
the extensive wealth of Search-Based Software Engineering techniques to
address this and other variability management challenges.},

For hierarchy detection, information retrieval techniques are employed as well as user decisions.},

	abstract = {Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) has proven successful on several stages of the software development life cycle. It has also been applied to different challenges in the context of Software Product Lines (SPLs) like generating minimal test suites. When reverse engineering SPLs from legacy software an important challenge is the reverse engineering of variability, often expressed in the form of Feature Models (FMs). The synthesis of FMs has been studied with techniques such as Genetic Algorithms. In this paper we explore the use of Genetic Programming for this task. We sketch our general workflow, the GP pipeline employed, and its evolutionary operators. We report our experience in synthesizing feature models from sets of feature combinations for 17 representative feature models, and analyze the results using standard information retrieval metrics.},
