In the last three chapters, we have presented our methodology to assess theperformance evolution history of configurable software systems. The first partcovered a catalog of methods to derive a variability model from the softwaresystem or related resources along with different strategies to select samplesets of variants. In the second part, we presented and evaluated differentstrategies to select a subset of revisions, for which performance measurementsapproximate the overall performance evolution history. The third part reviewedaspects on concrete performance measurement, including guidelines to follow when choosinga benchmark to test, and when summarizing measurement results across differentvariants and versions.While the evaluation of revision sampling strategies in the previous chapteralready presented some performance measurement results ex ante, in this chapter, weevaluate the applicability of our methodology with a case study. With our casestudy we intend to answer the following research questions:\begin{enumerate}[RQ1)]  \item \emph{Does the methodlogy meet its objectives?}  \item \emph{Does performance evolve?}  \item \emph{Does our methodology accurately describe performance evolution?}  \item \emph{Are our performance measurements reliable?}\end{enumerate}{\color{red}This chapter is organized as follows. In section 6.1 we present ourcase study corpus, i.e., the selection of configurable software systems that weassess performance for in our experiment. Section 6.1 addresses RQ1 bydocumenting how we followed our methodology throughout the experiment setup andconduction. Section 6.2 addresses RQ2  with an extensive description ofperformance evolution results and insights obtained from it. Finally, section6.3 addresses RQ3 and RQ4 by reviewing the accuracy of revision samplingstrategies and assessing the reliability of our performance measurementapproach.}\section{Case Study Corpus}\label{sec:casestudy}To evaluate our methodology, we selected two subject systems: GNU XZ andx264. The selection process accounted for the following requirements. First,since our intention is to assess the performance evolution history of aconfigurable software system, we limited our selection to mature softwaresystems that exhibit a development history of a couple years or more. Second,we limit our selection to software systems for which we can obtain afine-grained development history, usually version control logs. The rational is that our methodology considers the sampling of different revisions aswell as the possibility to manually inquire possible causes of performancechanges. Third, we intend to consider software systems that have already beensubject of related research, such as work on performance prediction models.This enables us to compare our results with, and place our results in thecontext of previous work. Lastly, the scope of this case study is constrainedby limited time. Hence, the selection of software systems to assess is notrepresentative, yet intended to validate the methodology presented earlier, andto obtain empirical insights on whether, and if so, how performance evolves forconfigurable software systems.Our case study corpus comprises two configurable software systems, GNUXZ\footnote{Find the project description of GNU XZ at\url{https://tukaani.org/xz/}.} and x264\footnote{Find the project descriptionof x264 at \url{https://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html}}.GNU XZ is a free file compression tool that is widely used across the open-source universe. GNU XZ provides a development history of about ten years,or more than 1,100 versions,  and is actively maintained as part of the GNUproject. It provides a publicly accessible Git repository as well as additionalresources, such as archived mailing lists and bug reports. The software itselfhas not been subject of related research, yet it has been frequently comparedwith other file compression tools with respect to compression performance. x264 is a free library implementation of the H.264 codec for video encoding,commonly known as MPEG-4. The implementation provides a command line interfaceto use and has been subject of previous research, including performanceprediction models\citep{siegmund_predicting_2012,siegmund_performance-influence_2015}. Similar toGNU XZ, x264 is a mature software system that provides a development history of almost ten years, or more than 2,800 versions. Both software systems are configurable at load-timevia command line arguments that modify the file compression process, or videoencoding process, respectively.\section{RQ1: Does the methodology meet its objectives?}\label{sec:expsetup}In the following, we document the application of our methodology to the twosoftware systems of our case study corpus. In particular, this section coversthe aspects of variability- and performance assessment since we have alreadycovered the results for revision sampling in chapter 4. All performance measurements made in thefollowing were conducted on a Linux machine (Debian 8) with a Intel XeonE5-2680 v2 with 2.8 GHz and 16 GB RAM. For each version and variant, werepeatedly executed  a benchmark five times and selected the median of theresulting measurements to minimize the impact of biased measurements.\subsection{Application of our methodology to GNU XZ}\paragraph{Variability Assessment.} For GNU XZ, we considered the application’sman page documentation to synthesize a variability model since we could notfind any more comprehensive documentation artifacts (cf. The use cases in Table3.1 and the questionnaire in Table 3.2).   GNU XZ is configurable at build-timevia command-line arguments passed to the program with every execution. Sincethe application is a file compression utility, it provides two operation modes,file compression and decompression. For our evaluation, we chose to assessperformance for file compression as most compression tools are compared bycompression performance rather than decompression. We extracted configurationoptions based on two criteria from the man page documentation. First, a commandline argument is a valid configuration option if it relates to the chosenoperation mode. This specifically excludes options, such as command linearguments to return the version number, or to affect user interaction. Second,a command line argument is a valid configuration option if it does not alterthe configuration of other options. This especially applies to presets which onthe one hand relate to the chosen operation mode, but on the other handpreselect values for other configuration options. While for some configurationparameters, domains were explicitly specified, for those options remainingunspecified we had to manually investigate minimum or maximum values bytrial-and-error. In total, we identified nine binary, four numericconfiguration options, and two constraints, resulting in $7.22 \times 10^{14}$possible variants considering the domains of numeric configuration options.Using pair-wise sampling (cf. Section 3.3), we selected 36 variants for whichwe assess their performance. We selected pair-wise sampling over the othermentioned sampling methods as we cover all pair-wise feature interactions withvery few configurations. The feature model in terms of configuration optionparameters has not changed during the development history as the man page hasnever been revised significantly. In fact, the documentation lists a number ofconfiguration options whose corresponding features have not been implementedyet, for instance support for multi-threading.\paragraph{Performance Assessment.} For GNU XZ, we selected the Canterburycorpus (2.8 MB) as the benchmark. The Canterbury corpus is a standardized set of files that isintended to be representative since it contains files of different types, suchas text or binary data. To measure performance of GNU XZ, we refer to theexecution time since the benchmark file as well as the implemented compressionalgorithm remain unchanged for all versions and variants. We conceive anyincrease in execution time as performance degradation, and any decrease inexecution time measurements as an increase in performance quality properties.Further possible performance indicators for GNU XZ beside the execution timeinclude the compression ratio (ratio of uncompressed input and compressedoutput), and the resource utilization. With respect to the limited scope of thethesis, and, for the sake of comparability, we only take into account executiontime.\subsection{Application of our methodology to x264}\paragraph{Variability Assessment.} For x264, similar to GNU XZ, the mostcomprehensive documentation, and, therefore our primary source of information for thesynthesis of a variability model was the software system’s man page. X264 isconfigurable at load-time and can be configured via command-line argumentspassed when executing the program. The software provides only one operationmode, the encoding of uncompressed video data, yet it can be tuned with a rangeof command-line parameters. We only selected those parameters as configurationoptions that relate to the operation mode, and excluded preset parameters. Forinstance, we excluded a command-line parameter that specifies how many videoframes at the beginning of the video should be dropped. In total, we identifiedeight binary options, twelve numeric options, and no constraint, resulting in$7.98 \times 10^{23}$ variants considering the domains of numeric configurationoptions.Using pair-wise sampling (cf. Section 3.3) we selected a sample set of eightvariants for which we assess their performance. As the binary configurationoptions are optional, we required very few configurations to cover allpair-wise feature interactions.\paragraph{Performance Assessment.} We selected an uncompressed video file (79.9MB) provided by the Xiph.org foundation as a benchmark to encode as an MP4 file.Similar to GNU XZ, we consider the execution time as the key performanceindicator since the benchmark file as well as the implemented encoding standardremain unchanged for all versions and variants. We conceive any increase inexecution time as performance degradation, and any decrease in execution timemeasurements as an increase in performance quality properties. Again, we couldconsider additional performance indicators, such as throughput in terms offrames encoded per second. However, with respect to the limited scope of thisthesis, and, to compare performance results across systems, we decided to onlyfocus on execution time.\\All in all, the methodology provided a guideline to obtainperformance evolution results. In particular, for the synthesis of variabilitymodels as well as the selection of suitable performance benchmarks, themethodology provided conceptual decisions interms of which use casre to referto. However, the methodology remains generic rather than concrete in otheraspects, such as the recommendation of variant- or version sampling strategies.For variant sampling, the specification of coverage criteria is left to thepracticioner, and, for version sampling, the suitability of a sampling strategymight also depend on the shape of the overall performance evolution history(cf. section 4.4).\section{RQ2: Does performance evolve?}\label{sec:expresults}We have evaluated the performance evolution history results regarding twoaspects, effect magnitude and effect range. For both aspects, we ask whetherthere are patterns or trends. A pattern in our context is a recurring shape ofsegments of an performance history curve. In addition, we define a trend as amore global increase or decrease in performance measurements that mightsuperpose local patterns.\subsection{Effect magnitude}To investigate the magnitude of changes in performance measurements, we considerthe relative changes from commit to commit rather than the absolute changessince most variants exhibited different levels of performance measures as somevariants performed better than others, depending on the respectiveconfiguration~(cf. section\,\ref{sec:relativechange}). To illustrate the relativeperformance changes, in Figure\,\ref{fig:relative_changes} we present the relative performance changesof the best- and worst-performing variants along with a medium performingvariant for both systems respectively.In addition, we provide a zero baseline (grey) to illustrate whetherperformance measurements increase (curve above the baseline) or decrease(curve below the baseline).\paragraph{Patterns.} For both systems we can see local fluctuations inthe relative performance changes. For GNU XZ, however, the different versionsfluctuate more heterogeneously starting from commit 250. For this first commit segment as well as for x264, commits with a performance degradation have commitmessages indicating the introduction of new features to the software system. Forcommits for which performance improves, commit messages suggest that programerrors have been fixed.\paragraph{Trends.} With respect to our zero-change baseline, we can see thatfor GNU XZ, the vast majority of commits result in a performance regression,while for x264, the distribution of performance-increasing and -decreasing commits is more balanced. This indicates a global trend for  GNUXZ, where performance has degraded over the course of ten years, while forx264, performance, besides more local fluctuations, has not degradedsignificantly.\begin{figure}[!htb]\def\tabularxcolumn#1{m{#1}}\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{@{}cXX@{}}\centering\begin{tabular}{c}\subfloat[GNU XZ]{\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{images/xz_changes.eps}}\\\subfloat[x264]{\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{images/x264_changes.eps}}\end{tabular}\end{tabularx}\caption{Relative commit-to-commit change in execution time in percent for GNUXZ and x264. Depicted are curves for three variants for both systemsresectively. The illustrated best-, medium-, and worst-performing variantexhibited the best, average, and worst average execution time across allversions.}\label{fig:relative_changes}\end{figure}\subsection{Effect range}To summarize the performance evolution with respect to the effect range, we askthe question whether multiple variants change homogeneously for the same version.Therefore, we first computed the relative performance change form commit tocommit for each variant. Second, we have computed the variance of relativeperformance changes per version. The rationale behind this is that if for a newversion all variants’ performance changes homogeneously, the resulting varianceis low, whereas if variants change heterogeneously, the resulting variance ishigh~(cf. section\,\ref{sec:changevar}). For both GNU XZ and x264, we present thevariance of performance changes over time in Figure\,\ref{fig:change_variance}. In addition to the smoothedcurve, we provide the global average variance to indicate global trends.\paragraph{Patterns.} Similar to the effect magnitude, we can see localfluctuations in the variance of performance changes for the beginning of GNUXZ’s history as well as throughout all of x264’s history. These fluctuationssuggest that for some time, variants evolved more homogeneously, followed by atime span where variants evolved more independently.\paragraph{Trends.} For GNU XZ, we identified a global increase in varianceamong performance changes while simultaneously, the amplitude of fluctuationsdecreased. That is, variants continued evolving more heterogeneously over thedevelopment history. Moreover, the older the software system, the fewerversions seem to change performance of all variants. For x264, however, weobserve more fluctuations throughout all the history, indicating that from time to timecommits did affect more variants than others. In addition, the variance doesnot increase on a global scope. This indicates that most variants kept evolvinghomogeneously throughout the development history.\begin{figure}[!htb]\def\tabularxcolumn#1{m{#1}}\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{@{}cXX@{}}\centering\begin{tabular}{c}\subfloat[GNU XZ]{\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{images/xz_variance.eps}}\\\subfloat[x264]{\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{images/x264_variance.eps}}\end{tabular}\end{tabularx}\caption{Variance of relative execution time changes across all variants of asoftware system. While the markers depict values for a single version/commit,the smoothened curve visualizes local trends. The baseline depicts the globalaverage variance of relative performance change.}\label{fig:change_variance}\end{figure}\subsection{What can be learn from a performance history?}\label{sec:expconc}The described performance results in the previous section suggest that bothsoftware systems exhibit different quality attributes with respect to theirsoftware architecture. In this last subsection, we place the observed resultsin the context of existing work on software evolution mentioned insection\,\ref{sec:evolving_solftware}.\paragraph{GNU XZ.} For GNU XZ, based on our observations, we can say that thesoftware architecture in the beginning was ductile in the beginning and got more brittleover the time since fluctuations in the performance change variance decreased;also, the variance of performance changes increased during the developmenthistory suggesting a more chaotic performance evolution for each variant. Thisis in line with our observation in Figure\,\ref{fig:ActivityGraphs}, where thebest-performing variant changes significantly stronger compared to the other two variants. Theconcept of technical debt \citep{guo_tracking_2011}, meaning a global trend ofperformance degradation can be identified as well. Interestingly, GNU XZ was revisedmore frequently in the beginning of the development history than more recently.All in all, the observations suggest that GNU XZ today exhibits a poor softwarearchitecture that has become brittle as most of the committed versions areolder than five years and very few commits did affect variants homogeneously.\paragraph{X264.} In contrast to GNU XZ, the observations for x264 indicate thatthe software architecture remained ductile during the development history for a number ofreasons. First, the fluctuations in the variance of performance changes did notdecrease significantly over time indicating that more recent commits can havethe same effect on performance as more older ones. Moreover, the overallvariance of performance change, besides the aforementioned fluctuations, didnot increase. Second, the performance measurements for x264 fluctuate, but donot exhibit a global trend similar to GNU XZ. This shows that both the effectmagnitude as well as the effect range for performance changes remained stableduring the development history. All in all, the observations suggest that the software architecture of x264 ismore mature than GNU XZ.\section{RQ3 and RQ4: Accuracy and Reliability}
